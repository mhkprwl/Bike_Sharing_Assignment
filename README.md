## General Information
- The project gives us the bike utilization dataset of a bike sharing company BoomBikes for 2018 and 2019 Year.
- The company expects us to analyze the entire dataset and give us a logical and mathematical ways to increase the bike utilization.
- Basically the company needs us to provide teh governing factors which can lead to hig comsumption of shared bikes.

## Conclusions
- Predicted Model (Variable details can be seen from Data Dictionary):
    -   cnt = 1.08e-12 x atemp + 6.537e-13 x hum + 674.4972 x casual + 1595.3723 x registered -4.547e-13 x Fall + 3.268e-13 x Oct -6.253e-13 x (18th Date) + 1.698e-12 x (27th Date) + 4505.2671
- Summer and Fall Season have observed high utilization of bikes, as compared to other seasons
- 2019 has observed high utilization of bikes.
- May, June and Jul have observed high utilization of bikes
- Slightly high utilization is observed when there is no holiday
- Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy has observed highest utilization of bikes, then comes Mist and cloudy
