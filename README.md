## General Information
- The project gives us the bike utilization dataset of a bike sharing company BoomBikes for 2018 and 2019 Year.
- The company expects us to analyze the entire dataset and give us a logical and mathematical ways to increase the bike utilization.
- Basically the company needs us to provide teh governing factors which can lead to hig comsumption of shared bikes.

## Conclusions
- Predicted Model (Variable details can be seen from Data Dictionary):
    -   cnt = 996.3916 x yr + 95.5334 x workingday + 1124.5479 x temp -223.4312 x hum -274.5594 x windspeed + 342.0299 x Summer + 527.6650 x Winter + 243.9040 x Sep - 207.2355 x  Mist - 343.9191 x Snow + 4491.3033
- Summer and Fall Season have observed high utilization of bikes, as compared to other seasons
- 2019 has observed high utilization of bikes.
- May, June and Jul have observed high utilization of bikes
- Slightly high utilization is observed when there is no holiday
- Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy has observed highest utilization of bikes, then comes Mist and cloudy
